# SwiftShadow Layout
This project is a Twitch Overlay that I use when streaming (specifically speedrunning). This is used in a Browser source in OBS that is placed on top of my gameplay/webcam/other elements I have on stream. Could be a useful reference for other streamers/devs that want to interact wtih channel points for their own streams as well.

### Current Features
* Support for channel point rewards being redeemed:
  * Chat members can give luck to me during a run as a channel point reward. This will pick from a set of messages to display on stream and play a sound effect.
  * Chat members will be able to replace my facecam with a supported emote of thier choice.

### Planned Features
* Support more emotes for the facecam emote reward. Look into a way of getting an emote URL just providing the name of an emote (I haven't found anything on this front yet).
* Chat members will be able to modify the color of my layout in some way.
* Connect with LiveSplit Server to be able to detect when I split/reset/gold a split.
